This project contains _Shell_ related tasks.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. &lt;0&gt;<br/>_**0-alias**_ creates an alias with the Name: `ls` and Value: `rm *`.
+ [x] 1\. Hello you<br/>_**1-hello_you**_ prints `hello user`, where user is the current Linux user.
+ [x] 2\. The path to success is to take massive, determined action<br/>_**2-path**_ adds `/action` to the `PATH`. `/action` should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program.
+ [x] 3\. If the path be beautiful, let us not ask where it leads<br/>_**3-paths**_ counts the number of directories in the `PATH`.
+ [x] 4\. Global variables<br/>_**4-global_variables**_ lists environment variables.
+ [x] 5\. Local variables<br/>_**5-local_variables**_ lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions.
+ [x] 6\. Local variable<br/>_**6-create_local_variable**_ creates a new local variable with the name `BETTY` and value `Holberton`.
+ [x] 7\. Global variable<br/>_**7-create_global_variable**_ creates a new global variable with the name `HOLBERTON` and value `Betty`.
+ [x] 8\. Every addition to true knowledge is an addition to human power<br/>_**8-true_knowledge**_ prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 9\. Divide and rule<br/>_**9-divide_and_rule**_ prints the result of `POWER` divided by `DIVIDE`, followed by a new line. `POWER` and `DIVIDE` are environment variables.
+ [x] 10\. Love is anterior to life, posterior to death, initial of creation, and the exponent of breath<br/>_**10-love_exponent_breath**_ displays the result of `BREATH` to the power `LOVE` followed by a new line. `BREATH` and `LOVE` are environment variables.
+ [x] 11\. There are 10 types of people in the world -- Those who understand binary, and those who don't<br/>_**11-binary_to_decimal**_ converts a number from base 2 to base 10 followed by a new line. The number in base 2 is stored in the environment variable `BINARY`.
+ [x] 12\. Combination<br/>_**12-combinations**_ prints all possible combinations of two letters, except `oo`.<br/>    &bullet;Letters are lower cases, from `a` to `z`<br/>    &bullet;One combination per line<br/>    &bullet;The output is alpha ordered, starting with `aa`<br/>    &bullet;Does not print `oo`<br/>    &bullet;The script file contains maximum 64 characters.
+ [x] 13\. Floats<br/>_**13-print_float**_ prints a number, which is stored in the environment variable `NUM`, with two decimal places, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 14\. Decimal to Hexadecimal<br/>_**100-decimal_to_hexadecimal**_ converts a number from base 10 to base 16. The number in base 10 is stored in the environment variable `DECIMAL`
+ [x] 15\. Everyone is a proponent of strong encryption<br/>_**101-rot13**_ encodes and decodes text using the rot13 encryption assuming the text is ASCII encoded.
+ [x] 16\. The eggs of the brood need to be an odd number<br/>_**102-odd**_ prints every ~~other~~ odd line from the input, starting with the first line.
+ [x] 17\. I'm an instant star. Just add water and stir.<br/>_**103-water_and_stir**_ adds the two numbers stored in the environment variables `WATER` and `STIR` and prints the result. `WATER` is in base `water`, `STIR` is in base `stir.`, and the result is in base `behlnort`.
