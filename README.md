## Intro 

This repository documents my journey learnig *__Shell Scripting__* at [ALX](alxafrica.com)

The goal it to take 2 hours each day to tackle the foundational knowledge of bash shell scripting.

This will not cover everything about __Shell Scripting__ but rather the areas that I feel will be important for me to understand in-depth
